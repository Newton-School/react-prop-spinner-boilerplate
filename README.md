Prop Based Spinner Component
Given data:
    1. CSS for spinner animations
        a. use class "anim-grow" for grow animation
        b. use class "anim-border" for border animation
    2. Colors for spinner variants as a JS object. Use the colors to set the background-color and the border-color of the spinner conditionally. 

You have to complete the Spinner component such that it renders the a div with the correct color variant and animation passed to it as prop.
You can check the CSS for spinner in App.css and you can see the variants in the test case code of App component.

Note: Give the spinner div id of "spinner".

*Border animation does not have any background color. So only set its border color. And grow animation has both background color and border color.
